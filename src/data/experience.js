      "Analyzed and translated user needs into system requirements for a hospital-wide Helpdesk platform, aiming to replace social media as the main complaint channel. Designed system architecture and conducted stakeholder analysis using UML diagrams, including Activity Diagrams, Use Case Diagrams, and Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD). Collaborated with end users, including Humas and internal hospital units, to iteratively validate requirements through user-centered validation and verification, ensuring alignment with real-world workflows. Facilitated communication between the development team and hospital units to maintain technical clarity and prioritize features effectively within a SCRUM framework. Conducted Specification Walkthroughs with developers to evaluate the clarity and feasibility of requirement documents. Documented system design decisions, data flows, and integration points with existing legacy systems used by Humas, ensuring that the new Helpdesk system remained compatible and seamlessly integrated for complaint routing and tracking. Maintained traceability between problem identification, solution design, and iterative MVP testing based on Lean Startup methodology. Supported frontend and backend developers by clarifying system behavior and bridging the gap between technical implementation and non-technical stakeholders.",
